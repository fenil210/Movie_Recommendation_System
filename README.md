# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains a movie recommendation system implemented in Python. The recommendation system uses a combination of TF-IDF and CountVectorizer algorithms to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. Additionally, it includes operations on CSV files and data visualization using PyPlot Express and Matplotlib.

## Dataset Description

>> The movie recommendation system uses a dataset in CSV format (IMBD.csv) containing information about movies, including the movie title, director, writer, cast names, genre, user ratings and so many other things.


## Operations on CSV Files and Data Visualization

== The repository includes Python code (csv_operations.py) that performs operations on the CSV file, such as loading the dataset, filtering movies by genre, and computing summary statistics. It also demonstrates how to create a bar chart using PyPlot Express to visualize the average ratings by genre.



## Movie Recommendation Using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer

== The movie recommendation system is implemented in the Python script movie_recommendation.py. It utilizes the TF-IDF and CountVectorizer algorithms from the scikit-learn library to analyze user preferences and provide personalized movie recommendations.

== The script includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input their movie preferences and see the top recommended movies based on their selections.

>> The GUI will prompt you to enter your movie preferences. Once you provide your preferences, the script will display the top recommended movies based on your choices.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following Python libraries:

>> pandas

>> scikit-learn

>> matplotlib

>> pyplot_express

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

> pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib pyplot_express
